# SimpleAsciiConverter
A simple image to ascii text art converter using Python PIL


I wanted to try out PIL and playing with image data and decided on this project. The main idea behind this project was the use of PIL to convert an image to grayscale. 
this would change every pixles in the image for an RGB value to a simple 0-255 grayscale value. Then for every pixel value, an ascii character would be assigned to 
convert it into ascii art.
